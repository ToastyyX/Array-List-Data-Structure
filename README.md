Welcome to first introduction into Data Structures & Algorithms!
I've recently made effort to finally begin teaching myself the concepts behind DS&A. 
I'm still new to this and I'm still trying to get familiar with it but I am excited to finally reach a new level of complexity in my Computer Science career.
My goal right now with these README files is to sort of provide a self-documentation with my journey on learning Data Structures & Algorithms.
I'm hoping to show you ( the reader ) my level of dedication and interest with this topic.
With time I'll update these files and try to provide my insight and knowledge into what I've learned so far. Again --> SELF-DOCUMENTATION <--
Thank you for reading and I'm hoping to be able to further develop these projects in the future.
